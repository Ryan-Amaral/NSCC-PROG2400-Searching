<p>A project for a Data Structures class at NSCC. This project contains two programs, the first compares sequential with binary search on an array. The second is a program that uses an AVL-Tree as a dictionary to efficiently check if words are misspelled in a given document.</p><br/>

<p>The program that compares sequential with binary search first creates an ordered array from 0 to LENGTH-1. Every number in the array is searched with both sequential and binary search. The overall times to find all numbers is displayed along with the average time to find each number.</p><br/>

<p>The second program uses an AVL-Tree to keep a balanced binary search tree to keep operations efficient. The program uses the AVL-Tree as a dictionary to be used as a sort of spell checker. Every word happened upon in the supplied document gets searched in the AVL-Tree, if it is not found it is considered misspelled.</p><br/>
